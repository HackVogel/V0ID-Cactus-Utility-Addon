If you have the AutoAuthorize module enabled, some servers will automatically recognize that you need to register, and in most cases, the add-on will do this for you! However, you may also have to do this manually with #authorize login or #authorize register. The AutoAuthorize module is currently still in beta, and if this does not work, you can let me know on Discord and send me the server IP.
